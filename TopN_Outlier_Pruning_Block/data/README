This directory contains data files for various data sets. These files can be 
used for testing an implementation of the TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block function, 
as they contain not only the data sets themselves but also the outliers and the 
outlier scores that should be returned by the function.

These files were written by the matlab_wrapper.c file, and are read by the 
wrapper.c file.
