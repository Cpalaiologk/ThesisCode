This directory contains data files for various data sets. These files can be 
used for testing an implementation of the `TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block` function, 
as they contain not only the data sets themselves but also the outliers and the 
outlier scores that should be returned by the function. These files were created
and are read by the `save_vardump` and `read_vardump` functions respectively.
