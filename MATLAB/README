This directory contains MATLAB code and scripts used by Joshua Spence during the 
completion of his thesis project.

SUBDIRECTORIES
==============
Datasets
    Contains data sets that can be used for testing the algorithms.
Lib
    Contains external libraries required for algorithm execution. Consists 
    mostly of MEX files.
TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block
    This directory contains various implementations of the 
    "TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block" function.

SCRIPTS
=======
clean.sh
    Remove any leftover files produced by the MATLAB code. Only removes file 
from the base MATLAB directory.
clean-testing.sh
    Remove any files produce by running the `josh_test' test scripts.
josh_profile.sh
    Profiles the execution of all "TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block" implementations 
    over all data sets.
josh_test.sh
    Compares the results produced by each "TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block" 
    implementation over all data sets.
